  "Here's what'll happen. Iâ€™ll deal 21 cards into three stacks, thn you will pick a card in your mind...but donâ€™t tell me!",

  "Ready to begin?"

-> user action = clicks yes
-> animation: dialogue box shrink animation 
-> animation: initial card dealing animation

2. 21 cards dealt on the screen (deal1)

 -> dialogue = 
 "Ok pick a card in your mind, but remember don't tell me", 
 "Just tell which stack it's in."
 -> animation: stack button appearance animation (after a few seconds)

3. Reorder cards (reOrderCards1)

5. Reorder cards (reOrderCards2)

6. Computer redeals cards (deal3)
  -> animation = re-dealing cards animation
  -> dialogue = "Last time â€” which stack is your card in now?"
  -> user action = User clicks stack number (playerChoose3)

7. Reorder cards (reOrderCards3)
  -> animation = gather cards final (just like the previous gather cards, but this time they go off screen once they are in a stack)

8. Reveal card (revealCard)
  -> dialogue = "Hmmmâ€¦ let me concentrateâ€¦ ðŸ”®", 
    "Yesâ€¦ yesâ€¦ I see it clearly now!",
    "Is this your card???"
 -> User clicks yes or no

 9. End (end)
