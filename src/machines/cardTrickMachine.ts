1. Green background, large dialogue box that explains what's about to happen. (intro)

  "Welcome! Iâ€™m your magician for today ðŸŽ©âœ¨",
  "I'm going to show you the 21 Card Trick.",
  "Here's what'll happen. Iâ€™ll deal 21 cards into three stacks, thn you will pick a card in your mind...but donâ€™t tell me!",
  "You just tell me which stack itâ€™s in, and at the end we'll see if I can guess your card (magic ball)",
  "Ready to begin?"

-> user action = clicks yes
-> animation: dialogue box shrink animation 
-> animation: initial card dealing animation

2. 21 cards dealt on the screen (deal1)

 -> dialogue = 
 "Ok pick a card in your mind, but remember don't tell me", 
 "Just tell which stack it's in."
 -> animation: stack button appearance animation (after a few seconds)
 user action: User clicks stack number (playerChoose1)

3. Reorder cards (reOrderCards1)
  
    -> dialogue = 
    "Great choice! Now let me shuffle the magic a littleâ€¦", 
    -> animation = gatherCards animation (cards fold up vertically, the row the user selected is in the middle)
    -> reorder with middle stack in appropriate place
   
4. Computer redeals cards (deal2)
-> animation = re-dealing cards animation (this is very similar to the initial card dealing animation, but the cards are dealt from a stack in the corner of the screen where they were collected)
-> dialogue = "Here's round 2! Which stack is your card in now?"
-> user action = User clicks stack number (playerChoose2)

5. Reorder cards (reOrderCards2)
    -> dialogue = 
    "Perfect. I can sense the magic buildingâ€¦", 
    -> animation = gatherCards animation 
    -> ensure cards are sorted with middle stack in appropriate place
    
6. Computer redeals cards (deal3)
  -> animation = re-dealing cards animation
  -> dialogue = "Last time â€” which stack is your card in now?"
  -> user action = User clicks stack number (playerChoose3)

7. Reorder cards (reOrderCards3)
  -> animation = gather cards final (just like the previous gather cards, but this time they go off screen once they are in a stack)

8. Reveal card (revealCard)
  -> dialogue = "Hmmmâ€¦ let me concentrateâ€¦ ðŸ”®", 
    "Yesâ€¦ yesâ€¦ I see it clearly now!",
    "Is this your card???"
 -> User clicks yes or no

 9. End (end)
  -> if yes: 
    dialogue = "Amazing, wasnâ€™t it? Want to go again and see if you can stump me this time?"
    animation = reset button appears
